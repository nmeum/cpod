cpod - cron(8) friendly podcatcher

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<cpod> [B<-h>] [B<-p> I<number>] [B<-r> I<number>] [B<-v>] [B<dir>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

cpod is a small cron(8) friendly podcatcher which is only responsible
for downloading podcast episodes. It doesn't play them, it doesn't
enqueue them and it doesn't track the episodes you already listend to. It
simply fetches them no more, no less.

If you don't pass any command line flags to cpod it will automatically
update all feeds and download all (new) episodes. Since cpod supports
continuous downloads you can also interrupted it at any point and the
next time you invoke it will automatically resume unfinished downloads
unless those unfinished downloads are no longer part of your episode
scope.

Downloaded episodes are stored in I<~/podcasts> by default, you can
specify an alternative directory by passing its path as the first
command line argument to cpod.

cpod is using a plain text file to store your podcast subscriptions. You
need to manually create this file before starting cpod, it needs to be
called I<urls.txt> and has to be located in your download directory.
Open the file with your favorite text editor and add your desired URLs
(one per line). The file path is documented in the B<FILES> section
below.

For OPML import and export two separated optional binaries are provided.
If you installed them take a look at cpod-import(1) and cpod-export(1)
in case your are seeking more information.
