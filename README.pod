cpod - cron(8) friendly podcatcher

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<cpod> [B<-d>] [B<-e> I<opml>] [B<-h>] [B<-i> I<opml>] [B<-r> I<episodes>] [B<-u>] [B<-v>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

cpod is a small cron friendly podcatcher written in go(1). It uses a
tiny json file to store your feeds but it doesn't track downloaded
episodes.  When your are done with a podcast episode you can delete it
and cpod won't fetch it again.

If you don't pass any command line flags to cpod it will automatically
update all feeds and download all new episodes. However, the options
described below might be used to change this behaviour.
